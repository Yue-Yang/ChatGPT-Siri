# 🤖️ Petey GPT + Multiple Language Support

bigplayer-ai fork:

This version has the following features:

— It works with Petey Application, which handles all the API calls more reliably than the shortcut version.
— It supports multiple languages. You can easily change the language by adjusting the second shortcut settings to your preferences. (Any pull requests for language improvement are welcome).
— It allows you to chat continuously, exit or start a new chat, customize your API key, prompt system messages, and hint messages.
— It automatically saves your chat data to a text file in different folders by day.

> To view your chat files, open the "Files" app and go to iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/ChatGPT-log. This feature requires iCloud sync and iCloud Drive enabled in 'Settings' - Apple ID - iCloud.

— It also supports sharing text to Shortcuts via Share Sheet on iPhone and Quick Actions on Mac for fast shortcut launching.
— It automatically copies the last response to the clipboard.
